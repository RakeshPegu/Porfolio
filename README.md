this is one of the project I have built for myself, so basically this is a portfolio project of mine   where i have used React.js for my frontend, and for backend I used Node.js, Expres.js and to style I used tailwindcss unlike other projects where i used css or sass to style , here i tried to focus on writting clean code and components reusability and  I tried to  practice atomic design principle to design the UI components, Basically We can say I focused on optimization of the Frontend and It's architecture
